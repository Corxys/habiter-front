The artists have located and interviewed individuals around the world about their personal observations of the effects of climate change in their regions. HABITER asks interviewees and viewers to consider what it means to “inhabit” a place, what “home” signifies, and what responsibilities we share as inhabitants of the Earth. \n \nWe are facing an unprecedented global catastrophe. \n \n“Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” \n- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014 \n \nThe IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations that assesses and synthesizes international climate research. In its last report, in 2014, the IPCC noted an increase in temperatures since 1950, the consequences of which are still debated. The increase in global temperatures is predicted to cause more intense and frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts, torrential rains or hurricanes. These meteorological changes transform the way people live and often result in temporary or permanent human displacement. \n \nHABITER exhibits the testimonies of individuals already affected by these changes. The compilation of multi-media testimonies addresses the complex effects of climate change on populations around the world, often complicated by global socioeconomic inequalities, as well as disparities in monitoring, preparation, response, rehabilitation and adaptation to disasters. Together, the testimonies depict snippets of a near global future, allowing us to understand the gravity and complexity of climate change and suggesting possibilities for adaptation.",

We thank our professors Claude-Hubert Tatot, Marianne Guarino-Huet, Olivier Desvoignes and Mathilde Chenin who supported and helped us throughout the creation of the project. Thanks to Anna Barseghian, Hannah Entwisle Chapuisat, Leonardo Milano, Julia Dao, Markus Stoffel, Markus Zimmermann, and Bernhard Aufdereggen for their guidance and for sharing valuable information. The online exhibition would not have been possible without the work of Jean Muller, graphic designer, and Jenny-Lee Boulanger, web programmer. Last but not least, we are immensely grateful to all the individuals around the world who participated in this project, sharing with us their extraordinary stories, experiences, observations, and advice. \n \nThank you all!"
