Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”",

        "We have interviewed people around the world who have already been affected by these changes. In compiling their testimonies, we aim to publicise and address the complex effects of climate change on populations around the world, often complicated by global technical, social and economic inequalities. The collection of testimonies depicts snippets of a near global future, allowing us to understand the gravity and complexity of climate change and suggesting possibilities for adaptation."
